# Unofficial-NSE-Repo
An unofficial nmap script (NSE) file repo for all the unmerged, unPR'd, and unloved nse scripts of the world.

If there is an NSE script that is not in here and no in the official NSE repo, make a PR to add it.

You can just use the clone script included to clone it down, try to make the second arg something unique, not just "NSE" or anything generic.
I'm not checking these so if you use them and bad things happen, that's on you sorry.

If there is something bad about a script (it's malware or something), make an issue and it will get removed.
